# Amazon Site Knowledge

## Page Structure
- Search results show price, rating, and Prime eligibility inline - no need to click into each product for basic info
- Product pages have multiple seller options - scroll to "Other Sellers on Amazon" for alternatives
- "Sponsored" labels indicate paid placements, not necessarily best matches

## Common Gotchas
- First result is often sponsored, not best match - check 2-3 results
- "Currently unavailable" products still appear in search - check availability before clicking
- Prices shown may be for used/renewed items - verify "New" vs "Used" in listing

## Efficient Navigation
- Left sidebar has brand, price range, and rating filters - faster than scrolling pages
- "Sort by: Price Low to High" helps find deals quickly
- Reviews summary at top of product page shows common praise/complaints
